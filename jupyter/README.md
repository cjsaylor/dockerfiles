# Jupyter Notebook

This is my personal Jupyter notebook setup. It is intended for single user mode as part of
the setup will remove the Jupyter Hub to get a more recent version of Node.

To build the image, run `bash build.sh`.

The end of the build script will provide the command to run the image.
